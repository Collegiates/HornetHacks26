# PictureMe

PictureMe is an event photo delivery platform that helps attendees find every professional photo they appear in without manually searching through a large gallery.

Users create an account, register their face during sign-up, and then use that face profile across events. Any user can create and host an event, which makes them that event's organizer. Organizers can upload photos, manage the event gallery, invite contributors who can also upload photos, and control those permissions per event. Other users can attend events and view gallery photos without receiving those advanced management privileges.

## Project Idea

PictureMe is designed to solve a common event problem:

- Organizers and photographers produce hundreds or thousands of photos.
- Attendees rarely have time to browse everything manually.
- Most people only care about the photos they are actually in.

The core idea is to combine account-based face registration, event-level roles, event check-in, and automated face matching so attendees can quickly access the photos that matter to them while organizers retain control of each event gallery.

## Intended User Flow

1. A user creates an account and scans their face so it can be registered to their profile.
2. Any user can create an event, which makes them the Event Organizer for that event.
3. The Event Organizer generates an event QR code and can also manually add attendees.
4. The Event Organizer can upload photos, manage the event gallery, invite contributors, and remove contributor privileges when needed.
5. Invited contributors can upload photos to that event and manage the photos they personally uploaded.
6. Attendees are associated with the event either by scanning the QR code or by being manually added by the organizer.
7. The platform processes uploaded images and compares detected faces against registered user face data.
8. Users receive a text message when new event pictures have been uploaded.
9. Inside the app, users can view their personal matched photos, browse the full gallery, and review all of their previous events.
